            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
                <p>I sort of stumbled upon coding as being <em>my</em> journey. It came about because I felt unskilled an incapable of having any pull
                     in any company that I could possibly go to. On top of that, working for the IRS just wasn't enjoyable to me and this comes after
                    I had found myself stuck at the post office for 6 straight years! By far the worst place I ever worked at, but that's a story
                     for another day.</p>
                <p>There's also the aspect of <strong>money.</strong>Supporting a family on my meager wages has just not been cutting it but I had
                discovered that coding is much more needed than I ever thought and could make at least two times what I make now! Of course money isn't
                everything but when I want to spend time with my family and take them on vacations, it's kind of a huge barrier!</p>
                <p> That left me with a question. How do I get a skill or something to help move me along in life so I'm not stuck anymore? Everyone
                    always said school. But I could never afford to go to college. It's just out of the question. So I looked at trade schools and looked
                    for anything even a little interesting to me. And that's when I found <strong><em>computer programing!</em></strong> The school was not
                    that expensive and I really like technology! But then I found out that I actually know people in the programming space. It was then that
                    I was given a copy of Jon Douglas's book <em>Part Time Programmer</em> and found out that it can be learned for free and is much more desired
                    in the job space than I ever could have hoped!</p>
                <p> So now that left me with a final thing to figure out. What is my career path? Well the book recommended me to research what 
                    is most popular in the area in which I want to work. <srong>OREGON!</srong> Okay now we have something to look at. So I landed on
                    Javascript. That's when I discovered <em> The Odin Project </em> and this was a sign! I have been very into Norse religion and
                    history due to my ancestry. And this jumped out at me! So my path was set! I've been working on <em> The Odin Project </em> for 
                    some weeks now and that is how I found myself here making webpages and blogs!</p>
                <p> I am so very excited to see where this takes me and I hope with all of my heart that I can dig myself out of this hole
                    I've found myself in! </p>
                <p> This will probably never be live anywhere but, This has been Wesley! <stong> Until Next Time!</stong></p>
